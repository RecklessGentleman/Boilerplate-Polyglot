# The Polyglot Boilerplate  
***
## What This Is
This is a simple headstart in making designs with straight HTML/CSS. It's set up so that you can simply open the project folder, run ``npm install``, type ``gulp``, and be on your way to designing. 

## Why "Polyglot"
Basically this project contains all the languages I know, except for PHP, MySQL, and the German I picked up from that one class in high school. Hopefully the combination of them all will help me see where I am in learning, and encourage me to expand my knowledge base in order to make this project more efficient.

### Disclaimer
To be honest, this is my first Github project. I have no idea if I'm doing this right.
